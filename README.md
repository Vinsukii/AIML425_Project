## Get Started

### Installation

* python $\ge$ 3.6.13
* pytorch $\ge$ 1.8.1
* gym $\e$ 0.18.0
* numpy $\ge$ 1.19.5
* pandas $\ge$ 1.1.5
* visdom $\ge$ 0.1.8.9

Note that pynvml is used in ```test.py``` to avoid excessive memory usage of GPU, please modify the code when using CPU.

### Introduction

* ```data_dev``` and ```data_test``` are the validation sets and test sets, respectively.
* ```data``` saves the instance files generated by ```./utils/create_ins.py```
* ```env``` contains code for the DRL environment
* ```graph``` is part of the code related to the graph neural network
* ```model``` saves the model for testing
* ```results``` saves the trained models
* ```save``` is the folder where the experimental results are saved
* ```utils``` contains some helper functions
* ```config.json``` is the configuration file
* ```mlp.py``` is the MLP code (referenced from L2D)
* ```PPO_model.py``` contains the implementation of the algorithms in this article, including HGNN and PPO algorithms
* ```test.py``` for testing
* ```train.py``` for training
* ```validate.py``` is used for validation without manual calls

## Reproduce result in paper

There are various experiments in this article, which are difficult to be covered in a single run. Therefore, please change ```config.json``` before running.

Note that disabling the ```validate_gantt()``` function in ```schedule()``` can improve the efficiency of the program, which is used to check whether the solution is feasible.

### train

```
python train.py
```

Note that there should be a validation set of the corresponding size in ```./data_dev```.

### test

```
python test.py
```
Note that there should be model files (```*.pt```) in ```./model```.

# Additional Instruction
* The output files are now in .csv format instead of .xls
* Test folder name now contain "-G" or "-S" to indicate used strategy (Greedy or Sampling)
* Train & test file now contain the enviroment setup (e.g 10 jobs & 5 machines -> "file_10_5")
* See the save folder in 'Code' for reference


## Config file (config.json)
* For training, update the env_paras and/or train_paras
* For testing, update the test_paras (specify the strategy here: sample = false is Greedy
                                                                 sample = true  is Sampling)


## Reproduction Results (Results folder)
* Each subfolder contains the trained model and the corresponding experimental results
* Test output files include testing time, mean/max/min makespan, mean/max/min runtime
* Train output files include training time, mean/max/min makespan
* The mean validation makespan graph is included in each 'save/train_...' folder
* All runs were done on the lab computer CPU (Intel i7-8700 12 cores @ 3.2GHz)


## Running
* Ensure the installation specification is met (specifically 'gym')
* Modify the config file if needed
* Navigate to the Code folder 
* Run python train.py or test.py
